Shin Ramyun instant noodles have been served on Korean Air flights for more than 25 years
If you're taking a flight on Korean Air, you might soon notice something missing from your menu - a cup of instant noodles.
From 15 August onwards, the carrier will stop serving the noodles to economy class passengers. It said the increased risk of turbulence, narrow aisles and passengers sitting closely together could mean "burn incidents occur frequently".
Business and first class fliers, however, will continue to enjoy the treat.
The snack has long been a passenger favourite and something the carrier is widely known for. Many praise the fact that it is available for free on request.
